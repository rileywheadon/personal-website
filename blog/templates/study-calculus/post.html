<p>As of April 2025, I’ve been a TA for 6 first-year calculus courses at
UBC. Students often ask me, “How do I succeed in this class?” (or “How
do I pass this class?”). Here’s my advice.</p>
<h2 id="dont-forget-the-basics">1: Don’t Forget the Basics</h2>
<p>With the fast pace of math courses, its easy to assume that you don’t
have time to review previous material. But I think this is a terrible
mindset. Calculus exams are unforgiving, and you <em>will</em> do poorly
if you don’t have a solid understanding of pre-calculus. I highly
encourage everyone who thinks they have gaps in their foundational
knowledge to review the following:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Exponent laws</li>
<li>Logarithm rules</li>
<li>Finding intercepts and asymptotes</li>
<li>Function composition and inverse functions</li>
<li>Trigonometric functions and the unit circle</li>
<li>Graphing basic functions like <span
class="math inline">\(e^{x}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sin
(x)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It shouldn’t take you more than a couple hours to go over these
concepts, and doing so and it will make the rest of your semester
<em>so</em> much easier.</p>
<h2 id="make-a-spreadsheet">2: Make a Spreadsheet</h2>
<p>Keep a list of questions you struggled with and write down what you
learned from them. I use a spreadsheet that looks like this:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 24%" />
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 40%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Question</th>
<th>Concept</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>WebWork 0, Question 1</td>
<td>Fundamental theorem of calculus.</td>
<td>Use the chain rule to differentiate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Color-code the questions: green if you understand everything, yellow
if you’re a little confused, or red if you’re completely lost. Only
include the questions you get wrong. This technique is a lifesaver
during exam season, providing a personalized list of challenging
questions for you to study from. Additionally, reading through the
“Notes” column before an exam helps recall the techniques you’ve learned
throughout the course.</p>
<h2 id="put-the-calculator-away">3: Put the Calculator Away</h2>
<p>If you came from the Canadian high school system, you were probably
allowed a calculator for your pre-calculus classes. However, calculators
are not allowed in the first-year calculus courses at UBC (and most
upper-year math courses). Some students live in denial of this policy
and continue using a calculator whenever possible throughout the
semester. Unsurprisingly, these students later lose marks on exams due
to computation errors. To minimize the chances of these silly mistakes,
I think its best to avoid using a calculator while doing practice
problems<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Mental math isn’t fun, but it is
necessary for success in calculus.</p>
<h2 id="embrace-the-struggle">4: Embrace the Struggle</h2>
<p>If you don’t have an exam soon, it’s okay to struggle with practice
questions. You often learn more this way than by asking a friend or
going to office hours. Trying new ideas and getting things wrong deepens
your understanding of the material. When you finally get the right
answer, you’ll understand not just <em>how</em> to solve the problem,
but <em>why</em> the solution works. Spending an hour on a difficult
problem can be more productive than doing ten easier problems in the
same period. Of course, if you’ve exhausted every idea you have, it’s
time to get help.</p>
<h2 id="practice-being-fast">5: Practice Being Fast</h2>
<p>If you have an exam soon, you should practice doing problems quickly.
I’ve found that math exams have more restrictive time limits than exams
in other departments, especially on midterms. The all-too-common
experience of “I remembered how to solve the problem after the test!” is
ultimately a problem of being too slow. Find out how long the test is,
find out how many questions there are, and ensure you can work fast
enough. The mathematics department posts <a
href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">tons</a> of practice
finals on their website. Ideally, you should try doing at least one of
these practice finals under exam conditions.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-writing-tests">6: Advice for Writing Tests</h2>
<p>Ensure you are well-rested and well-fed. Bring drinks/food/gum to the
exam if it helps you. Do not study within two hours of the test – do
something relaxing instead. Do not write tests while
drunk/high/hungover. If you are going to use stimulants, take a
<em>reasonable</em> amount. Yes, I know this is trivial stuff. And yes,
there are actually people who don’t do these things.</p>
<p>Okay, onto the more interesting advice.</p>
<p>If you can’t figure out how to do a problem in ~3 minutes, skip it
and come back to it later. You’d be shocked at how good your
subconscious is at coming up with ideas while you’re working on the
other problems. Additionally, leaving the hardest problems to the end
will help prevent you from ending up in a time crunch.</p>
<p>When checking your work, begin by making <em>sanity checks</em>. This
means asking questions like “Does my answer have the right sign?” or
“Does my answer seem unreasonably small or large?”. You can also do
these as you work. Certain types of problems can be solved <em>in
reverse</em>. For example, if a question asks you to evaluate an
integral, check that the derivative of your answer is the original
function. If your solution looks correct both forwards and backwards, it
is much more likely to be right. Other types of problems have multiple
viable solutions. If you see an alternative way of solving a problem,
try working through it. If you get the same answer using two different
methods, your answer is much more likely to be right.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>First-year calculus courses at UBC are challenging for everyone, even
math majors. I know someone who has taken over fifteen math courses at
UBC and still says the MATH 101 final was the hardest exam they’ve ever
written. Luckily, there are many resources available for students. Sign
up for Piazza, go to office hours, and discuss the material with your
friends. Success in these classes is not impossible—thousands of
students score above 80% in MATH 1XX every year. I believe that you can
be one of them. Good luck!</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>One exception to this rule is the written assignments in
MATH 100/101, which often require laborious calculations. I think you
should still try to solve these problems with pencil and paper, but
<em>definitely</em> check your answers with a calculator.<a
