<p>In January 2023, I did my first data analysis project on the
legislative process here in Canada. I used the <a
href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/overview">LEGISinfo</a> database
as my primary source of information, which contains a record of all the
bills created, read, and passed since 1994. After I downloaded
<em>literally all</em> the data from LEGISinfo<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I
built a web scraper with <a
href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">BeautifulSoup4</a> to
get more information about current and former members of parliament
(MPs). This data included their party affiliations, their roles in the
government or opposition, and the years they were active. Then, I used
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> to analyze the data and
<a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a> to create some visualizations<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. In this post, I’ll present <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span> simple charts that contain the results
of this analysis. I hope you find it interesting!</p>
<h2 id="part-1-making-the-bills">Part 1: Making the Bills</h2>
<p>In the Canadian Parliament, a <em>bill</em> is a proposed law that is
introduced for debate before becoming an official <em>act of
parliament</em>. Bills originate from one of Canada’s two legislative
chambers, the <em>House</em> and the <em>Senate</em>. All bills are
either <em>public</em> (pertaining to all people) or <em>private</em>
(pertaining to a specific group of people). If a bill is proposed in the
House, it must be public. Three groups of people can propose bills:
<em>senators</em>, <em>private members</em><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
and the <em>government</em>. The government consists of MPs<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> associated with the ruling party
(typically cabinet ministers). MPs not associated with the ruling party
are known as private members.</p>

Government bills are the second largest category, with 1189 bills. Of the \approx 700 bills proposed in the Senate, only 31 are private bills. Since MPs cannot propose private bills, private bills make up only \approx 0.5\% of all bills." />

<p>Canada has three main political parties: the Liberals, the
Conservatives, and the NDP. We also have some smaller parties, such as
the Bloc Quebecois (focused on Quebec), the Green Party (focused on
environmental issues), and the People’s Party (<del>focused on
conspiracy theories</del>). The Canadian Alliance was a now-defunct
offshoot of the Conservative party that existed from 2000-2003. In
Figure 2, the “Independent” category refers to MPs who are not
affiliated with any party.</p>

alt="Figure 2: Bills proposed by party in the House of Commons. Interestingly, the NDP have proposed the most bills, even though they have been consistently relegated to third-party status.

<p>The last aspect of bill creation I investigated was whether the
governing party proposed more bills than the official opposition. To
answer this question, I compared the number of bills proposed by the
Conservative and Liberal parties under Stephen Harper’s conservative
government and Justin Trudeau’s liberal government. The results of this
analysis are shown in Figure 3.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/templates/havoc-hill/bills-by-pm.png"
alt="Figure 3: Unsurprisingly, the governing party tends to propose more bills than the official opposition, by a \approx 25\% margin. Honestly, this margin was smaller than I expected. With all the partisanship in today’s political climate, it is easy to feel like all the opposition does is complain, but this plot clearly disproves such feelings." />

political climate, it is easy to feel like all the opposition does is
complain, but this plot clearly disproves such feelings.</figcaption>

<h2 id="part-2-reading-the-bills">Part 2: Reading the Bills</h2>
<p>A productive government should ensure that all proposed bills are
read. Whether the government actually passes these bills is more
nuanced, but at the very least I would hope the government is reading a
couple of bills a day. So here’s another plot, which shows the average
number of bill readings per day in the past <span
class="math inline">\(17\)</span> sessions of the House of Commons. This
statistic (and the similar statistic in Figure 8) uses the total number
of days that the parliament was in session, not the number of days in
which MPs actually met and read bills. Therefore, parliament probably
reads <span class="math inline">\(\approx 50\%\)</span> more bills than
Figure 4 suggests each time it sits.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/templates/havoc-hill/readings-per-day.png"
alt="Figure 4: A plot of readings per day in all parliament sessions since 1994. Stephen Harper’s minority conservative government between 2007 and 2010 read the most bills. Justin Trudeau’s 2015 majority government and 2019 minority governments read far fewer bills per day." />

Justin Trudeau’s 2015 majority government and 2019 minority governments
read far fewer bills per day.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to the <em>number</em> of bills read each day, I would
also hope that a productive government would either pass or fail the
bills in a reasonable amount of time. This can be measured with
<em>deliberation time</em>, or the length of time between a bill being
proposed and its last reading. If a bill fails upon the first reading,
its deliberation time will be short. However, the deliberation time
remains a useful metric for the bills that make it past the first
reading, since the majority of these bills are eventually passed (see
Figure 7). Thus, the median deliberation time serves as a proxy for a
government’s bill-passing speed.</p>

alt="Figure 5: Boxplot of deliberation times by prime minister. The median deliberation time appears to be approximately constant across the past four prime ministers. However, the 3rd quartile of deliberation times is noticeably higher under the two most recent governments, especially Justin Trudeau’s." />

alt="Figure 6: The distribution of all deliberation times in the dataset. As mentioned previously, many bills had deliberation times of &lt;50 days, since many bills fail.

<h2 id="part-3-passing-the-bills">Part 3: Passing the Bills</h2>
<p>To become law, a bill must pass <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> readings (<span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> in the House and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> in the Senate) and then receive
<em>royal assent</em> from the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada">governor
general of Canada</a>. Royal assent is essentially a formality in
Canada; even though the governor general has the power to strike down a
bill, no governor general has ever exercised this power. Figure 7 shows
the number of bills that pass each reading.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/templates/havoc-hill/bills-by-stage.png"
alt="Figure 7: The number of bills that passed each stage in the legislative process. Most bills fail at the first and second readings. However, a non-negligible portion of the bills also fail at the fourth and fifth readings, after the bill moves to the other legislative chamber. Very few bills fail at the third and sixth readings, and all bills that reach royal assent have been approved." />

</figure>
<p>Finally, I investigated how many bills were <em>passed</em> per day
in each session of parliament (recall that we were looking at the number
of bills <em>read</em> in Figure 4). The results of this analysis are
shown in Figure 8.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/templates/havoc-hill/bills-per-day.png"
alt="Figure 8: Bills passed per day in each session of parliament since 1994. The data show a steady decline in the number of bills passed per day, regardless of which party is in power and whether the government is a minority or a majority." />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I did a lot of analysis by political party in this blog post. This
should go without saying, but <em>the number of bills
read/passed/proposed by a political party should not be taken as a
measure of how good (or bad) the party is</em>.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, thanks for reading!</p>
