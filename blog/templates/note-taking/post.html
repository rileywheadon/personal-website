<p>Every day I get bombarded with more information than I can possibly
remember. From lectures to videos to random blog posts I stumble across
in my spare time, I estimate that my brain alone can recall maybe 10% of
what I consume. Before I started my knowledge management journey, the
other 90% would slip away, only to frustrate me later. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure
I learned how to do XYZ before, but I forgot and now I have to Google
it‚Äù was an all-too-common experience. This bothered me because I hate
doing things twice. To keep track of everything I‚Äôd learned, I started
taking a lot of notes. However, this quickly became messy, so I began
developing a way to stay organized‚Äìa <em>knowledge management
system</em>. After a year of effort, this system has grown to hundreds
of notes and improved my productivity significantly.</p>
<p>In this post, I will outline exactly <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> I
take notes. Obviously, what I do is tailored to my interests and needs,
and it may not work for everyone. At the very least, I hope reading this
gives you ideas and motivation for developing your own knowledge
management system.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, my goal is to never have to relearn a
piece of information. Every time I learn a mathematical theorem or
software library, I create a brief note and jot down any important
details. The information that goes into my system comes from a variety
of sources, including lectures, books, blogs, podcasts, and videos. You
might think that taking notes on a blog is overkill, but hear me out.
Taking notes forces you to not just understand the media you‚Äôre
consuming, but also summarize it.</p>
<p>According to Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy (<a
href="https://www.valamis.com/hub/blooms-taxonomy">source</a>), taking
notes moves you from remember/understand to at least apply. If you‚Äôre
being thorough, note-taking helps you deeply analyze what you‚Äôre reading
and find connections with other ideas. Yes, taking notes on a piece of
media probably takes 2-3 times longer than just reading it. But this is
a trade-off I‚Äôm willing to make. I‚Äôd rather read one book, learn it
well, and have a list of ideas to revisit later than read three books
haphazardly in the same time. If I learn something useful, I write it
down. It‚Äôs as simple as that.</p>
<p>When actually taking notes, I live by the rule <em>one idea, one
note</em> principle. In practice, this means I don‚Äôt make a note for
each piece of media I consume. Instead, I add ideas from what I‚Äôm
currently reading to related notes I already have. Note length isn‚Äôt
important to me. Some ideas require a lot of justification or context,
while others can be as short as 2-3 sentences. I do not create separate
notes for examples or practice problems. Instead, I include them under
an <code>Examples</code> or <code>Exercises</code> header within an
existing note. I believe that if a note really represents one idea, its
title should be short. If I can‚Äôt think of a concise title for a note,
the note probably shouldn‚Äôt exist.</p>
<p><strong>Obsidian</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve found digital note-taking with <a
href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to be the most effective
platform for my system. I‚Äôm not going to explain how Obsidian works
(there‚Äôs an excellent tutorial <a
href="https://help.obsidian.md/Home">here</a>), but I will outline why I
use it. First, Obsidian has an extremely low barrier to entry while also
being highly customizable and extensible. The plugin ecosystem for
Obsidian is unmatched; it has solutions for every conceivable use case
and more. Another advantage of Obsidian is that notes are stored as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> files, so
your notes will remain accessible even if Obsidian were to be
deprecated. Since notes are stored locally, Obsidian gives you complete
autonomy over your data, unlike cloud-based software such as <a
href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> and Google Drive. Finally,
Obsidian lets me edit my notes using <a
href="https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/for+Vim+users">vim-like</a>
key bindings, which makes editing text <em>so</em> much faster. Everyone
who spends a lot of time on their computer should learn vim, it‚Äôs
legitimately life-changing.</p>
<p><strong>File Structure</strong></p>
<p>The layout of my Obsidian vault is roughly based on the <a
href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">Johnny Decimal</a> system. I like this
philosophy for arranging my folders because it places a hard limit on
the amount of depth in my file tree. Why is depth bad? When you create a
new file in Obsidian, it gets placed in the same folder as the file you
currently have open. To avoid moving files around manually, it therefore
makes sense to keep your file tree as shallow as possible. Additionally,
the breadth of your file tree is no issue since Obsidian allows you to
search your entire vault at once. You <em>could</em> put every single
note and image into the root of your vault and Obsidian would work just
fine. The issues start when you need to get all the files related to a
certain topic. Then, <a
href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags">tags</a> or
folders are necessary. In conclusion, I would recommend setting up your
vault to use as few folders as possible while still maintaining some
semblance of structure.</p>
<p>Since my entire vault contains hundreds of notes, it can help to
create maps of content (MOCs), which are notes whose sole purpose is to
link to many other notes. I like to prefix my MOCs with the star (‚≠êÔ∏è)
emoji, which conveniently moves them to the top of the file explorer in
the sidebar. If I need nested MOCs, I‚Äôll prefix the second layer with
the home (üè†) emoji, which places these notes just beneath the starred
notes in the file explorer. For an example of what my file structure
looks like in practice, here‚Äôs a snapshot of my ‚ÄúUniversity‚Äù folder:</p>
<pre><code>/30 University
    /31 UBC
        Schedule.md
        Course Planning.md
        Todo.md
    /32 MATH 320
        /32.01 Notes
            ‚≠êÔ∏è MATH 320.md
            Least Upper Bound.md
            ...
        /32.02 Resources
            math-320-textbook.pdf
        /32.03 Assignment 1
            main.tex
            ...
            main.pdf
    /33 MATH 361
    ...</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Fuzzy Finder</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Fuzzy Finder</strong> is Obsidian‚Äôs mechanism for
searching a vault, which locates notes by folder and title
<em>simultaneously</em>. Then, by pressing <code>CMD + ENTER</code>, I
can effortlessly open the top search result in a new tab. This is
extremely useful because it allows me to create, delete, and switch
between notes without having to open a file explorer. Because the fuzzy
finder displays the file path, it‚Äôs possible to differentiate notes by
both their title <em>and</em> their location. Consider the following
file tree:</p>
<pre><code>/MATH-100
    formula-sheet
/PHYS-131
    formula-sheet</code></pre>
<p>If I search for <code>MATH 100 formula sheet</code>, the fuzzy finder
will only index the file in the MATH 100 folder, which allows me to have
many notes with the same title across my vault.</p>
<h2 id="plugins-and-extensions">Plugins and Extensions</h2>
<p><strong>LaTeX Suite</strong></p>
<p>The <a
href="https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite">Obsidian
LaTeX Suite</a> allows me to rapidly typeset <span
class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> using a set of customizable
snippets. I‚Äôm not going to elaborate on this plugin‚Äôs functionality
since I wrote a separate guide on it <a
href="../fast-typesetting/index.qmd">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Tables</strong></p>
<p>Obsidian allows you to edit text in two ways‚Äìlive preview and source
mode. Since I type a lot of <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span>
in my notes, I prefer using source mode in order to see exactly what I‚Äôm
typing. Unfortunately, this means I can‚Äôt use the new <a
href="https://obsidian.md/changelog/2023-12-26-desktop-v1.5.3/">Table
Editor</a>, which only works in live preview mode. To get around this
problem, I use the <a
href="https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian">Advanced
Tables</a> plugin, which gives me the functionality I need in source
mode. Particularly, I am able to:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Use <code>TAB</code> to cycle through cells.</li>
<li>Bind hotkeys to insert and delete both rows and columns.</li>
<li>Automatically align table border characters.</li>
<li>Add basic Excel-like formulas to my tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>This plugin only works in source mode, so if you use live preview, I
would just stick to the built-in table editor.</p>
<p><strong>Citations</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôve doing research since May, and this means dealing with <em>a
lot</em> of sources. I began using <a
href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> to keep track of my
references, but I wanted to have access to them within my Obsidian
vault. The way I added this functionality was with the <a
href="https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin">Citations</a>
plugin, which automatically imports sources from a Zotero folder. Note
that the <a href="https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/">Better
BibTeX</a> Zotero extension is required for this to work. The Citations
plugin also allows me to create ‚Äúliterature notes‚Äù containing relevant
metadata from any reference in my Zotero folder.</p>
<p><em>Update</em> (10/29/24): I am now using the <a
href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration">Zotero
Integration</a> plugin, although Citations is perfectly fine as
well.</p>
<p><strong>Excalidraw</strong></p>
<p>I do not own a drawing tablet, so it‚Äôs nice to have a way to create
quick, informal diagrams. I‚Äôve found the <a
href="https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin">Excalidraw</a>
plugin to work great for this use case. My favourite feature of this
plugin is the ability to seamlessly import drawings into my notes
without having to worry about exporting images from another piece of
software.</p>
<p><strong>Linter</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter">Obsidian
Linter</a> plugin ensures that the markdown files within your vault are
formatted consistently. It can do things like add a line break above and
below lists, automatically capitalize headings, and remove consecutive
empty lines. This normally wouldn‚Äôt matter to me but Pandoc (see below)
can get picky about markdown syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Pandoc</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> CLI application has
grown to be an <em>extremely</em> important part of my workflow. It
allows me to export markdown files from my Obsidian vault to almost any
other file type. I find this to be particularly useful when typesetting
mathematics since the document formatting syntax in <span
class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> is just awful. I‚Äôve used Pandoc to
produce research reports, assignments, and presentations using <a
href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer">Beamer</a>. Of
course, Pandoc trades control over document formatting for writing
speed. Personally, this is a sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to make. But if you
need to create professional documents, exporting markdown files via
Pandoc probably won‚Äôt provide enough capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Update</em> (10/29/24): Exporting markdown files to PDF proved to
be too cumbersome, so I am back to using <span
class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> for more formal writing.</p>
<p><strong>Quartz</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz</a> is the incredible
software I use to turn my Obsidian vault into a ‚Äúmini-blog‚Äù. It
seamlessly converts Obsidian-style markdown files to webpages and makes
it easy to add links and attachments. My website doesn‚Äôt have all the
features of a real blog, like comments and feeds. But I can quickly push
new posts and easily control the layout and style of my website, which
is all I need for now. If you‚Äôre interested in publishing your writing
quickly and easily, I would recommend giving Quartz a try. It‚Äôs even
simpler than other lightweight blogging software like <a
href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update</em> (08/01/2024): I‚Äôve decided to give <a
href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian Publish</a> a try, and I‚Äôve
found it to be even more straightforward than Quartz. However, Obsidian
Publish does require subscription ($8 USD/month or $4.80 USD/month with
the student discount).</p>
<p><em>Update</em> (10/19/2024): I‚Äôve moved the blog over to <a
href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> to improve support for code
snippets.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My Obsidian vault has grown to be more than just a note-taking
system. I now use it to make to-do lists, create schedules, journal,
and, of course, take notes. Using plugins and external software, I‚Äôve
extended my Obsidian vault to the point where it‚Äôs the only software I
need to produce documents of all kinds. By developing an efficient
system for note-taking, I‚Äôve made it easier to process the enormous
amount of information I‚Äôm exposed to every day. This has helped me learn
faster, write better, and study more effectively. If you‚Äôre interested
in trying something similar, the best time to start is now. All you need
to do is start writing.</p>
